# Coin_Detection
## Coin Detection and Annotation using OpenCV
## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and annotating coins in an image using OpenCV. The main objective is to identify coin positions accurately and visualize them for analysis or further processing.

## Features

 • Image Loading and Display: Supports reading images and displaying them using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

 • Thresholding: Prepares the image for coin detection by converting it to binary formats, including normal binary and binary inverse thresholding.

 • Coin Detection: Uses keypoints from OpenCV’s blob detection methods to locate coins.

 • Annotation: Each detected coin is annotated with:

    • A small dot marking the center of the coin.

    • A circle outlining the coin’s boundary.

    • Optional labeling for identification.

 • Visualization: The final annotated image is displayed for clear understanding of the detected coins.

## Methodology

• Preprocessing: The input image is converted to grayscale and thresholded to separate coins from the background.

• Keypoint Detection: Coins are identified as keypoints using blob detection or other suitable feature detection techniques.

• Annotation: Each keypoint is marked on the image with visual cues (dots and circles) to represent the coin’s location and size.

•Visualization: The annotated image is displayed to show the results of detection clearly.

## Notes

• Threshold values may need adjustment based on lighting and coin color.

• Morphological operations like erosion and dilation can improve detection by removing noise or enhancing coin boundaries.

• Keypoint detection parameters can be tuned to improve accuracy and detect coins of various sizes.

## Applications

• Automated coin counting systems.

• Educational projects for computer vision learning.

• Preprocessing for further image analysis tasks like coin classification or segmentation.
